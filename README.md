# Background
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. There were 3 machine learning models created: Logistical Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor. These models were used to determine candidate exoplanets based on a series of elements from a specific dataset. The details of each model will be presented including performance accuracy associated with predictions along with comparison analysis. 
# Model 1 - Logisitcal Regression
